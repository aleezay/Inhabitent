### A multipage Wordpress site for a Hipster Camping Company

This project was an introduction into creating a multipage Wordpress site with custom themes and plugins.

### TECHNOLOGIES USED

Wordpress
PHP
CSS/Sass,
Javascript/Jquery 
Gulp
MAMP

### IF I WERE TO REDO THIS PROJECT

I would go through all the pages before styling and find the common elements so I could be sure to only target them once.
This would make my CSS much cleaner.
